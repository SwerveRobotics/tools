# Swerve Robotics Tools Suite

Welcome to the Swerve Robotics Tools Suite. Here we hope you will find handy tools that will
help make your FTC programming days more productive and enjoyable.

At the moment, the suite contains the following tool(s):

*   __BotBug__: BotBug helps you debug your robot over Wifi by automatically configuring 
    robot controller phones for Wifi debugging whenever they connect to your PC using USB.
    Configure your robot controller phone normally as instructed in the FTC Guide, then take 
    the one additional step of also connecting the phone to a Wifi network which is also
    visible to your PC (so: the phone is *both* on Wifi Direct and this other network). Then
    plug the phone in using USB, acknowledge the one-time "allow USB debugging" prompt if 
    needed, and BotBug will take care of the rest.

    We hope in a future version to eliminate the need for the separate Wifi network by 
    connecting from the PC to the robot controller phone over Wifi direct, but that's not
    there right now.

    Sorry, BotBug only runs on Windows (v7 or greater), and we don't have the knowledge 
    or resources to port it ourselves to other platforms, though we would support anyone
    who might choose to undertake such a port.
