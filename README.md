# Swerve Robotics Tools Suite

Welcome to the Swerve Robotics Tools Suite. Here you will find tools that we hope will
make your FTC programming more productive and enjoyable. You might also enjoy our
related project, the Swerve Robotics FTC Library, also here on GitHub.

At the moment, the suite contains just one tool:

*   __BotBug__: BotBug helps you debug your robot over Wifi by automatically configuring 
    robot controller phones for Wifi debugging whenever they connect to your PC using USB.

    To setup Wifi debugging, configure your robot controller phone normally, just as instructed in the FTC Guide, then take 
    the one additional step of also connecting the phone to a Wifi network which is 
    visible to your PC (so: the phone is *both* on Wifi Direct and this other network). Then
    plug in the phone using USB, acknowledge the one-time "allow USB debugging" prompt if 
    needed, and BotBug will take care of the rest. Once BotBug has done its job, you can detach
    the phone from USB.

    BotBug automatically starts after install and restarts when your computer boots. It is 
    always running in the background, but can be temporarily disarmed by using the menu on 
    the Swerve icon in the notification area.

    Sorry, BotBug only runs on Windows (v7 or greater), and we don't have the knowledge 
    or resources ourselves to port it to other platforms, though we would support anyone
    who might choose to undertake such a port.

To install the Swerve Robotics Tools Suite, download a release from here on GitHub (look at
the top of this page just above the thick green line), then run the downloaded file.
We hope you find these tools to be useful. We'd love to hear what you think, and we will respond to
questions or issues you have as promptly as we are able.
